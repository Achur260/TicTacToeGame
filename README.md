Introduction

This basic Tic-Tac-Toe game is developed in Java using Swing components such as JFrame, JButton, JPanel, and ActionListener. 
The project demonstrates GUI development in Java while implementing event-driven programming and game logic. It provides a simple 
yet interactive interface for two players to compete in a classic Tic-Tac-Toe match.

Project Overview

The game features a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns placing their marks (X or O). The application continuously checks for 
a winner after each move and announces the result. The interface is built using JFrame and JPanel, with buttons (JButton) for user 
interaction. An ActionListener handles player moves, updates the board, and ensures the correct turn sequence. A restart option is 
also included, allowing players to restart the game after a win or draw.
